# Tariq - AI-Powered Traffic Management System 

## Project Overview 
Tariq is an AI-driven, real-time traffic management system designed to reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow in urban areas. By leveraging machine learning, real-time data processing, distributed computing, and Firebase, Tariq predicts traffic patterns, identifies congestion hotspots, and provides actionable insights for traffic management authorities.

The system uses:
- **Java Multithreading**: Simulates real-time traffic on multiple roads.
- **Machine Learning**: Predicts traffic congestion trends.
- **Apache Kafka**: Enables scalable, distributed data processing.
- **Flask API**: Serves machine learning predictions.
- **React**: Provides a web dashboard for live traffic visualization.
- **Firebase**: Stores real-time traffic data and user interactions.

### Key Features:
- **Live Traffic Simulation**: Simulates real-time vehicle counts on multiple roads.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Detects and logs congestion based on traffic conditions.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Predicts traffic congestion using machine learning.
- **Scalability with Kafka**: Ensures data is processed efficiently with multiple consumers.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visualizes traffic data and predictions live.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores real-time traffic data and user interactions.
